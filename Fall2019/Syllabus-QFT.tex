\item{\bf About the course:}

Quantum field theory is just quantum mechanics for an infinite number of degrees of freedom. The Standard Model in particle physics was formulated in the framework of quantum field theory. In addition, it has been successfully applied to many-body systems in condensed matter physics.

In this course, I will introduce to some basics of quantum field theory. Because of infinite degrees of freedom, quantum field theory not only involves many new conceptual
points but also many technically complicated computations. Therefore, this course will guide you, step by step, to develop the crucial computational techniques and to learn important concepts. Starting from canonical quantization, we will learn perturbative quantum field theory and quantum electrodynamics.

The course will continue to Spring 2020 during which we will cover path-integral, Yang-Mills theory, quantum chromodynamics, and hopefully Standard Model.

Any students are very welcome to audit this course.

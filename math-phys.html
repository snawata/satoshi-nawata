<h1>How to Study Mathematical Physics?</h1>

<p>
I often receive questions from students such as:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
“I am interested in the intersection between mathematics and physics.  
How should I study?”
</p>

<p>
“I like geometry, and I am fascinated by the fact that physics makes
non-trivial predictions in geometry. But quantum field theory looks
extremely difficult. How should I begin?”
</p>

<p>
“How can I enter research in mathematical physics?”
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
To be honest, I find these questions hard to answer in a concrete way,
because they are all <span class="kw-core">vague</span>. “Mathematical physics” is an
extremely broad field. The relationship between mathematics and physics
has many facets and a long history, and each researcher has their own
perspective on how the two subjects are related.
</p>

<p>
For instance, <a href="https://member.ipmu.jp/yuji.tachikawa/misc/qft-math.html" class="resource-link">Yuji Tachikawa lists 20 distinct topics</a> (written in Japanese, but AI translation will work well) regarding the relation between math and physics (such as Knot invariants/Chern–Simons theory and Quantum anomalies/Index theorems). These examples are only the tip of the iceberg. There are many more topics that lie at the interface between mathematics and physics.
</p>

<h2><span class="kw-core">For Physics Students</span></h2>

<p>
The study of quantum field theory uses a wide range of mathematics. I am often
asked, 
<blockquote>
“What mathematics should I study in order to research mathematical structures of quantum field
theory?” 
</blockquote>
Since quantum field theory itself is vast, the answer depends on which part you wish to pursue.
</p>

<p>
If you are a physics student, my advice is simple: begin by studying
quantum field theory itself—especially two-dimensional conformal field
theory, supersymmetric theories and string theory. Then, learn whatever mathematics turns out to
be missing as the need arises. This “<span class="kw-core">learn on demand</span>” approach is often
the most efficient and natural.
</p>


<p>
It is hard to overstate the influence of Edward Witten on modern theoretical
physics and mathematics.   In particular, his work initiated the subject now known as
topological quantum field theory (TQFT).
For anyone entering the field, reading his original papers will be one of the
best starting points.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    E. Witten:
    <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01217730" class="resource-link">Jones–Witten</a>,
    <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01223371" class="resource-link">Donaldson–Witten</a>,
    <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01466725" class="resource-link">Gromov–Witten</a>,
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9112056" class="resource-link">Mirror Manifolds</a>,
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9408074" class="resource-link">Vafa–Witten</a>,
            <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9411102" class="resource-link">Seiberg–Witten</a>.
  </li>
</ul>


<p>
A good example of a bridge between physics and deep mathematics is the
book <span class="kw-core">Mirror Symmetry</span>:
</p>


<ul>
<li>  <a href="https://www.claymath.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Mirror-Symmetry.pdf" target="_blank">
    <strong>Mirror Symmetry</strong> 
  </a><br>
Hori, Katz, Klemm, Pandharipande, Thomas, Vafa, Vakil, Zaslow
</li>
</ul>


<p>
It is a massive volume; do not feel pressured to read it cover-to-cover.
Working through some of its physics-oriented sections already provides
an excellent starting point.
</p>


<h2><span class="kw-core">For Mathematics Students</span></h2>


<p>
If you are a mathematics student, the following books are extremely
useful for future research at the interface between mathematics and
physics. They are written as pure mathematics, without explicit
reference to physical models, yet they form the conceptual and
technical backbone of modern mathematical physics.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
  <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-8176-4523-6" target="_blank">
    <strong>D-Modules, Perverse Sheaves, and Representation Theory</strong>
  </a><br>
  Ryoshi Hotta, Kiyoshi Takeuchi, Toshiyuki Tanisaki
</li>
 <li>
  <a href="https://www.nzdr.ru/data/media/biblio/kolxoz/M/MA/MAr/Humphreys%20J.E.%20Representations%20of%20Semisimple%20Lie%20Algebras%20in%20the%20BGG%20Category%20O%20(AMS,%202008)(ISBN%200821846787)(O)(303s)_MAr_.pdf" target="_blank">
    <strong>Representations of Semisimple Lie Algebras in the BGG Category 𝒪</strong>
  </a><br>
  James E. Humphreys
</li>
 <li>
  <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-8176-4938-8" target="_blank">
    <strong>Representation Theory and Complex Geometry</strong>
  </a><br>
  Neil Chriss, Victor Ginzburg
</li>
  <li>
  <a href="https://bookstore.ams.org/gsm-174" target="_blank">
    <strong>Quiver Representations and Quiver Varieties</strong>
  </a><br>
  Alexander Kirillov Jr.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Although these books describe purely mathematics, they underpin important parts
of modern mathematical physics—from geometric representation theory to supersymmetric theory and string
theory. Understanding them will later prove invaluable for research at the
interface between mathematics and physics.
</p>


<h2><span class="kw-core">Learning from Lecture Notes</span></h2>


<p>
Another excellent approach is to read lecture notes written by researchers working at the intersection between mathematics and physics.  I can list only a few of them from my own taste:
</p>

<h2><span class="kw-core">How to Find Research Problems</span></h2>

<p>
Students often ask how to find research problems. A good starting point is to pick a research paper that genuinely attracts you and begin reading it carefully. It is often very helpful to attend a seminar talk on the paper, or to watch its recording, in order to grasp its motivation and broader context. Research papers often contain <span class="kw-core">open problems, conjectures, or unexplored directions</span>—try to engage with them seriously.
If you find that you cannot solve these problems or develop them into a paper, simply move on to another work that captures your interest and repeat the same process. This cycle of reading, struggling, and moving on is a natural part of research. It is also extremely valuable to talk with experts: discussions with advisors and senior researchers can help you identify promising directions, clarify what is important, and refine vague interests into concrete research topics.
</p>


<blockquote>
<p>
“I am interested in category theory and its applications to TQFT.
How can I find research related to TQFT?”
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
For example, <a href="https://categorified.net/" target="_blank">Theo Johnson-Freyd</a> has done brilliant work in this direction:
Pick one of his papers and start reading it. Useful keywords in this direction include:
<span class="kw-core"><em> E_n-algebras</em>, <em>factorization homology</em>, <em>AKSZ</em>,
<em>holomorphic-topological twists</em></span>, and related topics.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
“I am interested in symplectic or algebraic geometry and its connection
to physics. How can I find research topics?”
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
For instance, homological mirror symmetry is a particularly rich area. Personally, I
am interested in applying the <span class="kw-core">Gross–Siebert program</span> to character
varieties (or Hitchin moduli spaces) related to the Deligne exceptional
series, with the goal of understanding DAHA representation theory via homological 
mirror symmetry.
</p>

<p>
A good starting point is:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>P. Bousseau: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.02266" class="resource-link">Strong positivity for the skein algebras of the 4-punctured sphere and of the 1-punctured torus</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
Other topics I am personally interested in include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>H. Kim, J. Manschot, G. W. Moore, R. Tao, X. Zhang: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23042" class="resource-link">Path Integral Derivations of K-Theoretic Donaldson Invariants</a>.</li>
    <li>Braverman, Finkelberg, & Nakajima: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02112" class="resource-link">Ring objects in the equivariant derived Satake category arising from Coulomb branches</a></li>
    <li>Tomoyuki Arakawa:</em> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.01945" class="resource-link">Associated varieties and Higgs branches (Survey)</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you read and understand these papers, I can suggest concrete
research problems related to them.
</p>

<p>
What is written here is, again, only the tip of the iceberg. Mathematical
physics is vast, and this page could easily grow without bound. I will
therefore stop here.
</p>

<p>
Stay curious, stay open-minded, and keep studying.

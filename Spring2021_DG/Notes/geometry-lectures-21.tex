\title{Differential Geometry and Topology in Physics: Spring-2021}

\author{Satoshi Nawata}
\date{}
  \maketitle

\abstract{These are lecture notes of the course at Fudan in Spring 2021, and I write these by wishing that more students will be interested in the relationship between geometry and physics. Homework sets can be found in the \href{https://sites.google.com/site/snawata/teaching/spring-2021}{website}. These notes are written by referring to various sources without mentioning them. Comments are welcome. If you find typos, please email me.}
